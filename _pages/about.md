Hi everyone. I'm Jon. I'm a Stanford Genetics PhD Candidate researching the genetic and environmental causes of prostate cancer, and their role in disparities between populations. I'm passionate about science advocacy and science policy revolving around health equity, STEM education, and science funding. 

I'm also pretty good at playing Quidditch.
